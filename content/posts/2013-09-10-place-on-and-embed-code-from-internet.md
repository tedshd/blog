## Place on and embed code from internet

We can use [cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com/) or some library sites embed js or css.
But
How can we embed our code from internet?
I have 2 ways.

### GitHub
If you can use GitHub
Push your code to GitHub
Wtach code on GitHub
Find **Raw** and click it.
open code like
```
https://raw.github.com/tedshd/jQuery_scroll_to_top/master/javascripts/scroll_to_top.js
```
and then delete **.** after raw like
```
https://rawgithub.com/tedshd/jQuery_scroll_to_top/master/javascripts/scroll_to_top.js
```
Embed it finally.

### Dropbox
Place on code in dropbox.
Share this code
get share link like
```
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ie4b129u0thjcyw/logdown_theme.css
```
and replace **www** as **dl**
```
https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ie4b129u0thjcyw/logdown_theme.css
```
